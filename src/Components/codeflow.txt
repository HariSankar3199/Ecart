from Product.jsx 97 we call button addCart(which is a state)
its eventhandler calls a function conataining redux dispatch action 

***ReduxFlow***
redux
   ->action
       -->index.js ->define two fn to handlecart
   ->reducer
       -->index.js ->combine reducers & import handlecart.js
       -->handleCart.js -> reducer fn containing state and action
   ->store.js //from index.js of reducer

   1// We use redux to add product to cart
   2// In action we tell them what we want to do
   3// In Reducer we tell how it works 
   4// Now add them in root reducers
   5// Create store
   6// import them in Index.js (we did in App.js) and Integrate them
   7// call them in product .js by handling addCart
   8//Showing number of item  in cartbutton(addCart)->Cartbuttonpage(Navbar button)
   9// Create cart component
